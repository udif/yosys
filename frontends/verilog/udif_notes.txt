Goal: Add support for typedefs and structs (and hence typedef struct) to Yosys (under the -sv flag).

Project stages:
1. Update Lexer (verilog_lexer.l) to recognize 'typedef', 'struct', 'packed', 'unpacked' keywords.
   New tokens, TOK_TYPEEF, TOK_STRUCT, etc.
2. Update Parser (verilog_parser.y) to correctly parse the syntax and to fail with syntax errors when incorrect syntax is used.
   Unsupported construct might be optionally failed with a more descriptive message.
3. Extend the AST types (../ast/ast.h) and generate the new AST tree constructs in the parser.
4. Extend the AST front end to recognized the extended AST types and generate the correct RTLIL constructs.

Implement structs by extending the AST with either AST_TYPEDEF ot AST_STRUCT.
The AST parser should then do the same stuff done by AST CONCAT_LIST and concat_list rule in verilog_parser.y

Need to update hierarchical_id to handle struct hierarchy.
